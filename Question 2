2A) 
A swarm or fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is a set of aerial robots i.e., drones that work together.
The flight of the drones is controlled either manually, i.e. by remote control operations, or autonomously by using processors deployed on the drones.


2B) 
Use the Arduino IDE with ESP8266 support to write program  for the ESP8266.
Utilize the ESP8266WiFi library for WiFi connectivity or the ESP8266HTTPClient library for HTTP communication, depending on your application.
Write code to connect to your WiFi network and handle data communication protocols such as HTTP, etc
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_________________THIS IS A CODE WHICH I HAD USED IN MY EARLIER PROGRAM WHILE MAKING DRONE_________________
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>

const char* ssid = "your_SSID";
const char* password = "your_PASSWORD";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  delay(10);

  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");
  }
  Serial.println("WiFi connected");
}

void loop() {...}

2C)
- Autonomous Flight and Landing Capabilities: Ensuring the UAVs can take off, navigate autonomously, and land safely is crucial.
To operate without human intervention, essential for tasks such as search and rescue missions where immediate response and minimal human risk are our main priorities. 
- Object Detection and Recognition: Equipping the UAVs with high-resolution cameras and machine learning algorithms for real-time object detection and recognition in varied environmental conditions 
- Communication and Coordination Between our UAVs: Implementing swarm communication codes that enable all the drones to share information about detected targets using technologies.
- Weather Durability: Designing drones that can sustain to weather conditions, such as rain, wind, and varying heat conditions.


2D)

Sensors required for our question are as belows, and according to the question our path should be THIS : -
- Lidar Sensor: to detect obstacles and measure their dimensions. It stops the drone if an obstacle of height 15cm is encountered.
- Color Sensor: Activated when an obstacle of the specified height is encountered. It identifies the color of the object; the target color is green.
- GPS Sensor: to know the current loc. home location and target location.
- ESP8266: To call other 2 drones when the required target "Green object of heoght 15cm is reched". So that they stop searching and go back to land.
  If the colour is NOT green, Search continues.

In the whole scenario we have given :
- A UAV drone system is designed, that will operate using flight controller.
- For the communication purpose swarm technology is used.
- Open field test flight is initiated through remote.
